Haskell Examples
================

Coin change
-----------
If you have only 2 paise and 3 paise coins, you can make change for 6 paise in 2 ways (2+2+2 or 3+3). Given an amount A and a list L of available coin denominations find the number of ways to make change for A using only the denominations available in L. Bonus: find the minimum number of coins needed.


N-th L number
-------------
Let L =  p1, p2, ... , pk   be a list of k primes  in ascending order. Any number N all of whose prime factors are in L is called a L-number. The smallest L-number is 1. The second is p1. Write a program that finds the n-th L-number.
